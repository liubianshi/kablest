Description: Convert regress model results to a `data.frame`,
    `kable`, `flextable`, or other similar object. The output object can
    be printed directly to pdf, html or docx file. `tabreg` provides
    some common settings. The output object can be further precessed,
    such as adding lines and footnote, merging cells, adjusting
    output format, etc. In additional, the way of procesing model
    results and output format can also be customised.
